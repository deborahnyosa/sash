 <h1 id="b2" class="yellow">Poverty</h1>
   Most people in our community do not have money to purchase new hair fashion.
   They are not even aware about hairs.
   Some shave their hairs because they don't have enough money to mantain their hairstyle.

   <h3 id="c3" class="green">Lack of education skills</h3>
     Most people have no idea about new hairstyle fashion.
     Others are not creative on plaiting hairs.
     I want to start a training school in the community to help people who are willing to do hair dressing
     and also to help them learn more about hair dressing and learn new types of hairstyle.
